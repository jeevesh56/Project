# Sign-Up and Login Flow Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the Mo-Mo app's authentication system to ensure a smooth user experience for both email/password and social sign-in methods.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Google Sign-In Flow
- **Account Selection**: Users are now forced to select an account when signing in with Google
- **Loading Indicators**: Added loading dialogs during authentication to provide user feedback
- **Email Confirmation**: After successful Google sign-in, users see a confirmation dialog showing their email
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and fallback mechanisms for popup-blocked scenarios

### 2. Improved Apple Sign-In Flow
- **Loading Indicators**: Added loading dialogs during Apple authentication
- **Email Confirmation**: Similar to Google, users see their email confirmation after successful sign-in
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages for various Apple sign-in failure scenarios

### 3. Enhanced Email/Password Authentication
- **Pre-Validation**: Before creating an account, the app checks if the email already exists
- **Smart Mode Switching**: Automatically switches between login and sign-up modes based on user actions
- **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages with actionable guidance
- **Password Strength**: Clear guidance on password requirements (minimum 6 characters)

### 4. Improved Database Storage
- **Consistent User Data**: All authentication methods now store consistent user profile information
- **Provider Tracking**: Added `providerId` field to track how users signed up
- **Verification Status**: Track email verification status for all users
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling for database operations

### 5. Enhanced Navigation
- **AuthWrapper**: Created a dedicated wrapper to handle authentication state changes
- **DashboardWrapper**: Proper wrapper for dashboard access with authentication checks
- **Better Route Management**: Improved route handling and navigation flow
- **Logout Handling**: Enhanced logout functionality with proper error handling

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- **Email Confirmation Dialog**: Shows users their email after social sign-in
- **Account Linking Information**: Informs users they can use the same email for both social and regular login
- **Security Guidance**: Provides information about setting passwords for social accounts
- **Remember Credentials**: Enhanced credential saving with better user prompts

## How It Works Now

### Sign-Up Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. App checks if email already exists
3. If email exists, suggests login instead
4. If email is new, creates account and redirects to login
5. User logs in with newly created credentials

### Google Sign-In Flow
1. User clicks Google sign-in button
2. Google account picker appears (forced account selection)
3. Loading dialog shows during authentication
4. After success, email confirmation dialog appears
5. User sees their email and can continue to dashboard
6. Same email can be used for regular login later

### Apple Sign-In Flow
1. User clicks Apple sign-in button
2. Apple authentication flow begins
3. Loading dialog shows during authentication
4. After success, email confirmation dialog appears
5. User sees their email and can continue to dashboard

### Login Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. App validates credentials
3. If email not found, suggests sign-up
4. If password wrong, shows error message
5. If successful, navigates to dashboard
