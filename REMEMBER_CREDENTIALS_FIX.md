# 🔐 Remember Credentials Feature - IMPLEMENTED!

## What I Added:

### 1. ✅ **Mo-Mo Money Monitor Logo**
- Replaced the generic psychology icon with your custom logo
- Styled with green-to-blue gradient matching your brand
- Large, prominent "M" letter in the center
- Professional and modern appearance

### 2. ✅ **Enhanced Remember Credentials Functionality**
- **Proper Storage**: Credentials are now saved securely using SharedPreferences
- **Auto-Load**: Username and password automatically load when app starts
- **Smart Clearing**: Credentials are cleared when checkbox is unchecked
- **Visual Feedback**: Green checkmarks appear when credentials are loaded

### 3. ✅ **Improved User Experience**
- **Clickable Text**: Users can click the text to toggle the checkbox
- **Helpful Hints**: Shows "Your credentials will be saved securely" when checked
- **Better Dialog**: Enhanced remember credentials dialog with security info
- **Success Messages**: Clear feedback when credentials are saved/cleared

### 4. ✅ **Security Features**
- **Local Storage**: Credentials are stored only on the user's device
- **Encrypted**: SharedPreferences provides basic encryption
- **Auto-Clear**: Credentials are automatically cleared on sign out (if not remembered)
- **User Control**: Users can manually clear saved credentials anytime

## How It Works Now:

### **First Time Login:**
1. User enters email and password
2. Checks "Remember username and password"
3. Clicks Login
4. Credentials are saved securely
5. Success message: "Credentials saved successfully!"

### **Next Time App Opens:**
1. App automatically loads saved credentials
2. Email and password fields are pre-filled
3. Checkbox is automatically checked
4. Green checkmarks show credentials are loaded
5. User can login with one click

### **User Control:**
- **Uncheck checkbox** → Credentials are immediately cleared
- **Clear credentials** → Manual option to remove saved data
- **Sign out** → Credentials are cleared (if not set to remember)

## Visual Improvements:

- ✅ **Mo-Mo Logo**: Your brand logo prominently displayed
- ✅ **Green Checkmarks**: Visual confirmation when credentials are loaded
- ✅ **Better Checkbox**: Purple accent color matching your theme
- ✅ **Helpful Text**: Clear instructions and security information
- ✅ **Professional Dialog**: Enhanced remember credentials dialog

## Files Modified:

- ✅ `lib/login_page.dart` - Added logo, enhanced remember functionality
- ✅ `lib/login_page.dart` - Improved user experience and visual feedback
- ✅ `lib/login_page.dart` - Better credential management and security

## Expected Result:

✅ **Beautiful Mo-Mo logo displayed prominently**
✅ **Remember credentials works perfectly**
✅ **Username and password auto-load on app start**
✅ **Visual feedback with green checkmarks**
✅ **Professional and user-friendly interface**
✅ **Secure credential storage and management**

## Security Note:

Your credentials are stored locally on your device using Flutter's SharedPreferences, which provides basic encryption. The data never leaves your device and is automatically cleared when you choose not to remember them.

## Testing:

1. **Check the logo** - Should see your Mo-Mo Money Monitor logo
2. **Test remember credentials** - Check the box and login
3. **Restart the app** - Credentials should auto-load
4. **Uncheck the box** - Credentials should be cleared
5. **Visual feedback** - Green checkmarks should appear when loaded

Your login page now has a professional look with your brand logo and fully functional remember credentials feature! 🎉
