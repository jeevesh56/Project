- **Automatic text extraction** using Google ML Kit
- **Visual scanning frame** with corner indicators

### 2. Image Import
- **Gallery access** to import existing images
- **Multiple image formats** support (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- **Image optimization** for better OCR results

### 3. Text Processing
- **Multi-line text extraction** from documents
- **Accurate character recognition** using Google's ML Kit
- **Real-time processing** with progress indicators
- **Copy to clipboard** functionality

### 4. User Interface
- **Modern dark theme** design
- **Intuitive controls** with clear button labels
- **Results display** with scrollable text area
- **Clear and copy actions** for extracted text

## How to Use

### Accessing the OCR Scanner
1. Open the Mo-Mo app
2. On the login page, you'll see a **circular OCR Scanner button** in the middle
3. Tap the scanner button to open the OCR interface

### Using Camera Scanning
1. Grant camera permission when prompted
2. Point your camera at the document/text you want to scan
3. Position the text within the scanning frame
4. Tap the **"Scan"** button to capture and process the image
5. Wait for text extraction to complete
6. View the extracted text in the results section

### Using Image Import
1. Tap the **"Import"** button
2. Select an image from your device's gallery
3. Wait for the image to be processed
4. View the extracted text in the results section

### Managing Results
- **Copy text**: Tap the copy icon in the app bar to copy all extracted text
- **Clear results**: Tap the clear icon to reset and start over
- **Scroll**: Use the scrollable text area to view long extracted text

## Best Practices

### For Better OCR Results
1. **Good lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting when scanning
2. **Clear text**: Use documents with clear, readable text
3. **Stable camera**: Keep the camera steady when scanning
4. **High contrast**: Use documents with good contrast
5. **Proper positioning**: Align text within the scanning frame

### Performance Tips
1. **Image quality**: Use high-resolution images for better accuracy
2. **Processing time**: Larger images may take longer to process
3. **Memory management**: Clear results when done to free memory
4. **Network**: Internet connection required for ML Kit processing

## Future Enhancements
- **Batch processing**: Scan multiple images at once
- **Language support**: Multiple language recognition
- **Text editing**: In-app text editing capabilities
- **Export options**: Save extracted text to files
- **OCR history**: Save and manage previous scans
- **Advanced formatting**: Preserve text formatting and layout

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera not working**: Check camera permissions in device settings
2. **No text found**: Ensure good lighting and clear text
3. **Slow processing**: Check internet connection and image size
4. **Permission denied**: Grant camera and storage permissions

### Error Messages
- "Camera permission is required": Grant camera access in settings
- "No cameras found": Device doesn't have a camera
- "Failed to process image": Check image format and internet connection
- "No text found in the image": Try a different image or better lighting

## Security & Privacy
- **Local processing**: Images are processed locally when possible
- **No data storage**: Scanned images are not permanently stored
- **Permission-based**: Only accesses camera and storage when needed
- **User control**: Users can clear results and deny permissions
